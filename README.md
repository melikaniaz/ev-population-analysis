# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis ðŸš—âš¡

This project is a small data analysis I did on the **Electric Vehicle Population Dataset**.  
The main goal was to practice cleaning data, exploring it step by step, and finally creating some visualizations that can be turned into a simple automated report.

## What I worked on
- Cleaning the dataset: removing empty columns/rows and fixing data types  
- Looking at the trend of EV registrations over the years  
- Checking which car brands have the most EVs in the dataset  
- Comparing BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) vs PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid) share  
- Exploring the relation between **electric range** and **base price (MSRP)**  
- Automating the process of exporting the charts into a **PowerPoint report**
## Tools I used
- **Python** with pandas for data handling  
- **matplotlib** for plots  
- **python-pptx** for generating the report
